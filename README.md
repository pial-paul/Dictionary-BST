# Dictionary Using Binary Search Tree (BST)

## Overview
This project implements a **digital dictionary** using the Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. It allows users to efficiently **insert**, **delete**, **search**, and **display words** along with their meanings in alphabetical order.

---

## Features
- **Insert Words**: Add new words with meanings while avoiding duplicates.
- **Delete Words**: Remove words with proper handling for leaf, single-child, and two-child nodes.
- **Search Words**: Find a word and display its meaning, or notify if it doesn’t exist.
- **Display Dictionary**: View all entries sorted alphabetically.
