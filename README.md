# Dictionary Using Binary Search Tree (BST)

## Overview
The **Dictionary Using BST** project is a Data Structures application designed to implement a digital dictionary using the Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. It allows users to perform operations like adding words, deleting words, searching for words, and displaying all entries in alphabetical order.

This project demonstrates efficient storage and retrieval of data while showcasing the practical application of BSTs in solving real-world problems.

## Features
1. **Insert Words**
   - Add new words with their meanings to the dictionary.
   - Prevents duplicate entries.

2. **Delete Words**
   - Remove a word and its meaning from the dictionary.
   - Handles deletion for leaf nodes, nodes with one child, and nodes with two children.

3. **Search Words**
   - Search for a word in the dictionary.
   - Displays the meaning if the word is found, or notifies the user if it doesn't exist.

4. **Display Dictionary**
   - Traverses the BST in in-order (alphabetical order) to display all words and their meanings.

## How It Works
The program uses a Binary Search Tree (BST) where:
- Each node represents a word and its associated meaning.
- Words are stored alphabetically for efficient searching and retrieval.

### Operations:
- **Insertion**: Adds a new word and ensures no duplicates exist.
- **Deletion**: Efficiently handles various deletion cases (leaf, single child, two children).
- **Search**: Traverses the BST to find a specific word.
- **In-Order Traversal**: Displays all words and their meanings in alphabetical order.

## Program Structure
- **Programming Language**: C
- **Key Files**:
  - `dictionary.c`: Contains all the code for the dictionary operations.
- **Core Functions**:
  - `createNode`: Creates a new BST node.
  - `insert`: Adds a word to the BST.
  - `deleteNode`: Deletes a word from the BST.
  - `findElement`: Searches for a word in the BST.
  - `inorderTraversal`: Displays all dictionary entries in alphabetical order.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/dictionary-using-BST.git
   cd dictionary-using-BST
   ```

2. **Compile the Code**:
   ```bash
   gcc dictionary.c -o dictionary
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   ./dictionary
   ```

4. **Use the Menu**:
   - Choose from the available options:
     - [1] Insert a word.
     - [2] Delete a word.
     - [3] Search for a word.
     - [4] Display all entries.
     - [0] Exit.
